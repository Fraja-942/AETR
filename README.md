Article 8
Rest periods
1. A driver shall take daily and weekly rest periods as defined in article 1,
paragraphs (o) and (p).
2. Within each period of 24 hours after the end of the previous daily rest period or
weekly rest period, a driver shall have taken a new daily rest period.
If the portion of the daily rest period which falls within that 24-hour period is at
least 9 hours but less than 11 hours, then the daily rest period in question shall be
regarded as a reduced daily rest period.
3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, within 30 hours of the end of a daily or
weekly rest period, a driver engaged in multi-manning must have taken a new daily rest
period of at least 9 hours.
4. A daily rest period may be extended to make a regular weekly rest period or a
reduced weekly rest period.
5. A driver may have at most three reduced daily rest periods between any two
weekly rest periods.
6.(a) In any two consecutive weeks, a driver shall take at least:
(i) Two regular weekly rest periods; or
(ii) One regular weekly rest period and one reduced weekly rest period of at
least 24 hours. However, the reduction shall be compensated by an equivalent
period of rest taken en bloc before the end of the third week following the week
in question.
A weekly rest period shall start no later than at the end of six 24-hour periods from the
end of the previous weekly rest period.
